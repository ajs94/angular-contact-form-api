# angular-contact-form-api
a VERY basic api to receive requests from the 'angular-contact-form' app.
Contains a POST route for putting JSON body data to a file in the root folder, and a GET route for reading from the file.

From command line, use 'npm run dev' to start the development build of the application.
By default right now, it's hosted at port 6060

From command line, use 'npm run build' build the application.
